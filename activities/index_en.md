# Activities

A learning hour comprises several activities. Often one of the activities will be writing code to solve a [code kata](../kata_descriptions/index.html). The other activities might involve (virtual) sticky notes or talking in pairs or writing a few sentences about something. This part of the site details some kinds of activities you can adapt for many different kinds of topics and learning goals.
