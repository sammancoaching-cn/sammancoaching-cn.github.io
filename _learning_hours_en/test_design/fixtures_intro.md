# Test Fixture Introduction

Reduce duplication by using a test fixture. Let's look at the basic syntax.

## Session Outline

* 5 min connect: Duplication and Readability
* 10 min concept: Test Fixture 
* 30 min concrete: convert code to use fixture
* 5 min conclusions: What is a custom assert, what is a test fixture

## Connect: Duplication and Readability
- Give me three reasons why code duplication can be a problem. 
- Is duplication in test code an exception? Is it a problem?

## Concept: Test Fixture
Explain what it is, show them the documentation for the language and framework you're using.

## Concrete: Convert duplication to fixture

In [RecentlyUsedList](https://github.com/emilybache/custom-start-points/tree/master/start-points/RecentlyUsedList2/C), or [RecentlyUsedList](https://github.com/emilybache/RecentlyUsedList-Test-Design-Kata) there are several tests which share common code. Explain the problem and give them some pointers about how to refactor the tests to use a test fixture.

## Conclusions
Note down in your own words what you learnt about a custom assert and a test fixture.
