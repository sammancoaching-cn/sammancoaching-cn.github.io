# Text-based testing

This is almost the same as Approval testing. This session introduces texttest on some fun programs.

## Session outline

* 2 min connect: characteristics of Approval testing
* 15 min connect: introduce Approvals Puzzles
* 10 min concept: Text-Based testing
* 10 min concrete: Demo Approvals Puzzles
* 15 min concrete: Solve Approvals Puzzles
* 5 min conclusions: Strategies for varying output

### Connect: characteristics of Approval testing

What are the characteristics of approval testing? Can you tell me 3?

### Connect: introduce Approvals Puzzles

In small groups, look through these [Puzzles](https://github.com/emilybache/Approvals-Puzzles). Which ones could you test with approval testing? Which ones would be easier to test a different way? Write down your choices and problems with approval testing.

### Concept: Text-Based testing

Similar to approvals, but always text. Demo [TextTest](http://texttest.org) on a simple program.

### Concrete: Demo Approvals Puzzles

Demo solutions to these [Puzzles](https://github.com/emilybache/Approvals-Puzzles) using TextTest. Show them the documentation for the config file.

### Concrete: Solve Approvals Puzzles

Let the group loose on the puzzles and get them to solve them with TextTest.

### Conclusions: Strategies for varying output

Review your choices for the [Puzzles](https://github.com/emilybache/Approvals-Puzzles). Do you still make the same choices? Can you think of any more kinds of program output that would not be suitable for Approval testing?
