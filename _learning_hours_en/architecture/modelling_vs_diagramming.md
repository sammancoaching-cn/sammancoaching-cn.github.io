# Modelling vs Diagramming

Before we get into designing container diagrams we should talk about [the difference between a model and a diagram](https://c4model.com/#Modelling).

## Session outline

* 5 min connect: tools you know
* 10 min concept: Modelling
* 5 min concept: intro to Structurizr
* 25 min concrete: make a model for Instavoiced
* 10 min conclusions: note down facts about modelling

### Connect: Diagramming and modelling tools you know
What do you use to make architecture diagrams? Add notes with names of tools to a shared whiteboard. Put a plus marker by any which you have used.

### Concept: Modelling
Present the main ideas outlined in [Diagramming vs Modelling](https://c4model.com/#Modelling)

### Intro to Structurizr
[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) is an example of a modelling tool. I found I could get a free account to try it out. This was sufficient to begin to understand what a modelling tool is and how it differs from a diagramming tool. Give people a brief demo of how to use the tool to create a Context diagram and where to find the documentation.

There is a [starting position](https://github.com/emilybache/Instavoiced-Architecture-Kata/blob/main/instavoiced_starting_point.structurizr) in the DSL with some styling set up, which you could give them.

### Concrete: Model Instavoiced
Ask them to create a model that will produce the Context diagram which they came up with in the previous session [Simon Brown's 4C model - Intro](simon_brown_4c_context.html).

If they have time, they could go on to model a Container diagram too.

### Conclusions
Compare the diagrams produced by the different groups. If you like, show them a sample solution from the [Instavoiced materials repo](https://github.com/emilybache/Instavoiced-Architecture-Kata)

Have them note down any facts they want to remember about architecture modelling.
