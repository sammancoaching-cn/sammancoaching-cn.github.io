# FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For
numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print "FizzBuzz".

Sample output:

	1
	2
	Fizz
	4
	Buzz
	Fizz
	7
	8
	Fizz
	Buzz
	11
	Fizz
	13
	14
	FizzBuzz
	16
	17
	Fizz
	19
	Buzz
	... etc up to 100

## Follow-up requirements

When you have the above program working, extend it with the following rules:

- Multiples of 7 are “Whizz”
- Multiples of 11 are “Bang”

That means for example that multiples of 3 & 7 are “FizzWhizz”, multiples of 5 & 11 are “BuzzBang” etc. Extend your printout so it continues beyond 100 and stops the first time you get "FizzBuzzWhizzBang".


### Acknowledgments
This kata is described on cyber-dojo.org, I added the follow-up requirements.
