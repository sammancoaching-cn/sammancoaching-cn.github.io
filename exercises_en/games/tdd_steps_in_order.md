# Order of TDD steps

Print out the list of steps below and hand a copy to each participant. Ask them to spend one minute writing what order to do them in.

(This is a 'Fast pass' 'Take a Guess' activity)

- Refactor duplication
- Write a new test case that fails
- Review the requirements and note down a 'todo list' of test cases
- Make a failing test pass
- Commit to version control
- Cross off a test case from your list
- Run all the tests to make sure they still pass

When the minute is up, ask them to compare their answers with their neighbour. After 1 more minute ask if anyone has questions or inconsistencies between their answers. Answer their questions yourself or if time allows, ask if anyone else in the group can answer first before filling in any details they missed.
