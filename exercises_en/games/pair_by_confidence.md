# Pair by confidence

Have everyone stand up and stand at one side of the room. Ask them to walk a few steps towards the other side of the room in proportion to their answers to these questions. More confidence means they should walk further:

- confidence with (whatever programming language we'll use)
- confidence pair programming
- confidence with unit testing

Have people form pairs with someone standing in a different part of the room so you get pairs with varying experience. Hopefully these will be good pairs to work in later on in the session.
